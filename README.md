# Milk Chocolate
ingredients( ¾ cup (140 g) cocoa butter
¾ cup (80 g) cocoa powder
¼ cup (30 g) milk powder, soy milk powder, almond milk powder, or rice milk powder
1 cup (100 g) confectioner’s sugar, 1 cup (240 mL) agave syrup, or 1–2 teaspoons (4.9–9.9 mL) liquid stevia
Salt (optional—to taste)
Makes approx. 12 oz (340 g) of chocolate)

Recipe(Measure out your ingredients. For this recipe, you’ll need 1 cup (100 g) of cocoa powder, 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of coconut oil, 4 tablespoons (59 mL) of honey, and 1⁄2 tablespoon (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract. Use a series of measuring cups to portion out each ingredient in a small cup or bowl.[1]
Measuring your ingredients in advance will make the cooking process more efficient once it comes time to put it all together.
If you like, you can also add ¼ cup (25 g) of confectioner’s sugar, 1⁄4 cup (59 mL) of agave syrup, or 3-6 drops of liquid stevia to lend a little more sweetness to your chocolate.[2]


2
Melt 1⁄2 cup (120 mL) of coconut oil in a small pot over low heat. Turn on your cooktop to the lowest heat setting and add the coconut oil to the pot. Allow it to melt completely. Coconut oil has a low melting point, so this should only take a few seconds.[3]
Keeping the coconut oil moving continuously at the bottom of the pot will help it liquefy faster.
Tip: If possible, use stainless steel cookware to prepare your homemade chocolate (or another type of nonstick cookware that’s safe to soak). Otherwise, cleanup can be quite a hassle.



3
Add 4 tbsp (59 mL) of honey and ½ tbsp (7.4 mL) of vanilla extract. Use a whisk or metal spoon to scrape the sticky honey into the pot. Then, drizzle in the vanilla. Stir the ingredients into the melted oil until they dissolve and form a thin, syrupy mixture.[4]
Be sure to keep your cooktop on a low heat setting. If the oil gets too hot, it could scorch the sugars in the honey and spoil the flavor of the finished chocolate.
If you wish to add any other sweeteners, such as confectioner’s sugar or stevia, do it at the same time that you add the honey and vanilla.


4
Sift in 1 cup (100 g) of cocoa powder gradually. Rather than dumping all of the cocoa powder in at once, add it a little at a time. As you do, keep your whisk or spoon moving to help distribute the cocoa powder evenly throughout the mixture.[5]
You’ll have an easier time mixing the cocoa into your other ingredients with a whisk than you would with a spoon or spatula.


5
Take the chocolate off of the heat and continue stirring it as it thickens. You’ll know your chocolate is done when the chocolate takes on a smooth, dark color and the surface becomes slightly glossy. At this point, it just needs to be left to harden.[6]
Removing the pot from the hot cooktop will prevent the chocolate from burning.


6
Transfer the warm chocolate to a nonstick surface to cool. Carefully pour the chocolate out of the pot and onto a flexible nonstick baking mat or cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.[7]
You can also pour your chocolate into a decorative candy mold to create bite-sized treats with fun shapes.
Avoid adding your chocolate to any nonstick type of container, or those treated with a commercial cooking spray. This usually won’t be enough to keep it from sticking.

Refrigerate your chocolate for 1 hour before enjoying it. Once it’s fully set, it will be firm enough to break into pieces or remove from the mold. Enjoy![8]
Store your finished chocolate in the refrigerator, or simply keep it in a covered container on your countertop for easy access. Most types of dark chocolate have a shelf life of about 2 years.[9]
If your chocolate begins to melt or soften at room temperature, you can place it back in the refrigerator at any point to harden it back up.
